Bug Reports (GitHub Issues) Quality Checker.

**Motivation**.
The quality of bug reports is paramount for the overall quality of a software project:
[poorly formulated bug reports](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html) often lead to wasted time,
programmers frustration, and delays.
This repository is a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that would trigger
on every new issue submitted, check that issue for quality problems, 
and report them in the issue as a comment, asking bug reporter to fix the report.

### How to use

Consider this configuration:
```yml
name: reports-check
on:
 issues:
   types: opened
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: tracehubpm/reports-check-action@latest
        with:
          openai_token: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_TOKEN }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

### Configurations

Quality checker can be configured the way you want.
These are the parameters you can use/override:

* `openai_token`: Open AI API key, you can obtain it [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
* `github_token`: GitHub token to post messages in the issue's comments.
* `openai_model`: Open AI ChatGPT model, the default one is `gpt-4`.
* `deepinfra_token`: Deep Infra API key, you can obtain it [here](https://deepinfra.com/dash/api_keys).
* `deepinfra_model`: Deep Infra API model, the default one is `Phind/Phind-CodeLlama-34B-v2`,
check out [all available models](https://deepinfra.com/models/text-generation).

### Issues to ignore

You can configure this action to ignore some incoming issues.
They can be feature requests or just questions.
To do so, you can use `exclude` and pass to it an array of regular expressions.
Consider this configuration:

```yml
name: reports-check
on:
 issues:
   types: opened
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: tracehubpm/reports-check-action@latest
        with:
          openai_token: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_TOKEN }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          exclude: '["^I have a question*.+$", "^I want to request new feature*.+$"]'
```

### Quality Evaluation Process

Each bug report goes through quality evaluation process, where
your report will be assessed by those configured criteria using `.rules.yml` placed in the root of the repo:

TBD..

If your bug report does not match these criteria, it will be **rejected automatically** by robot.

Quality criteria are based on several researches, including:
* [Painless Bug Tracking, by Joel Spolsky, 2000](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/11/08/painless-bug-tracking)
* [What Makes a Satisficing Bug Report? by Tommaso Dal Sasso, Andrea Mocci, and Michele Lanza, 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309151102_What_Makes_a_Satisficing_Bug_Report)
